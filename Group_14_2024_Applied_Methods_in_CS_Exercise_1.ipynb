        "\n",
        "We saw in class how Waze utilizes Dijkstra's Algorithm as a fundamental component of its routing system. Dijkstra's Algorithm is a graph search algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph. In the context of Waze, cities and roads are represented as nodes and edges in a graph, respectively. Each road segment is assigned a weight that reflects the estimated travel time, considering factors such as road type, traffic conditions, and speed limits. When a user inputs a starting and destination point, Waze's implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm efficiently explores the road network to compute the shortest route. This algorithm ensures that users receive real-time, optimal directions that consider both distance and current traffic conditions.\n",
